Hi,

I am myself also a developer and I need an other developer's help on the project in order to finish it quick.
The project is a nodejs web app and this web app will run on raspberry pi. So ve have limitted hardware resorces. 
Plese keep in mind this issue and I also need sugesstions on this project to make it run faster in this limited env.

The baseline has been developed and the requested jobs are easy tasks. I will dived the needed jobs into small parts
I will continue with the same developer if I had a good comunication.

The scope of the work is form to add edit save a json file issues and list the files in a directory.

Please suggest in your request the way you make this app faster. This will be a selection criteria.

we will work on a github repo. you can use c9 like cloud ide to show me the job done. Good comunication is important.

screen captures can be shared upon request.

1- Meterials are json files. (there can be more than one) There is a form to create new,edit and delete meterials. 
new creation will write the form fields as json file. The edit and delete will also act as needed


2-Printer profile is another json file (it is only one file) we have one screen to edit and save it.

3-There is an upload form I finished the code. I just want to list the files in a directory and give it a link.

4-Job creator is an other page with a form. you give the job a name. select a print file (these are the files that the user uploaded
(a combo will list all uploaded files and user will chose one)) There is a meterials combo (meterials created in 1) the create job button 
will call a python code with the form arguments. Python code is already developed and I will share it with you. The important think here is the create job button will
be disable and the caption will be Processing... we will wait the python finish execution. After it finished we will enable the button and
go to an other page.

5-Print manager is a simple one page. There will be one combo and the button will execute another python code. the button will be disable
upto python finish its execution.

we are using faye pub sub server for near realtime comunication. These code already developed. The pages are also near its final stage.
Be sure that this is very little work and a meeting test to findout our dream developer.

Hope to work with you.

Nuri Erginer
